# Token Sales & Distribution

With low capital expenditure, we don't require to invest significantly and allocate funds for our growth. We benefit from developing transactions between providers and customers and raise $25 million to allocate towards our different city growth, educational programs,  community forums, and various marketplace platforms. The funds crowdfunded through the sale of UNIT tokens will create millions in dollars of transactions for providers,  customers, community members,  and support the creation of a fair economy within these different industries. 

Total Circulating Supply : 100 milion UNIT

50 million of UNIT tokens sold in five rounds: 

$0.10 for 10mil UNIT total of 1mil USD at 1mil market cap  
**$0.20 for 10mil UNIT total of 2mil USD at 4mil market cap**  
$0.40 for 10mil UNIT total of 4mil USD at 12mil market cap  
$0.80 for 10mil UNIT total of 8mil USD at 32mil market cap  
$1.00 for 10mil UNIT total of 10mil USD at 50mil market cap  

20 million UNITs go to the core team and extended team, where each of UNIT co-founders and partners receives 100,000 UNITS with a three-year cliff and a five-year vesting period. 
30 million sit in the Access (A) and Base (B) Treasury to maintain a level of stability and not be susceptible to volatility and the fluctuations that most tokens face currently. 

Current  round and valuation: at this stage, we’re raising 2 million USD at 4 million market cap.  


# Revenue Generation

UNIT generates revenue through transaction fees linked to the transactions that are created through and within the portfolio platforms (marketplaces, and Unit Global). 
The revenue generated through transaction fees is divided in 4 equal parts to reward different 4 stakeholder groups within the platform:  

25% - Direct: the one, who brought the customer onto the platform  
25% - Direct: the one, who brought the provider onto the platform  
25% - Indirect: the UNIT community (that is, everyone who owns a UNIT token)  
25% - Indirect: the marketplace community (that is, everyone who owns a token of the respective platform, where the transaction took place)  

Transaction fee percentage  (valued in USD):    
20% up to 1,000 USD  
10% 1,000 to 5,000 USD  
5% above 5,000 USD  
We offer a flexible transaction fee structure for nonprofits, partners, and via community-builders scholarships program  
When distribution of the transactions fees occurs, all indirect transaction fees get converted to UNIT tokens, which are then burned and removed from the ecosystem, therefore reducing the total token supply, which ultimately increases the token value.
