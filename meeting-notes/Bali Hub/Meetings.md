# Themes discussed: 
Construction and architecture for Unit Token Village

# Notes:

Colun’s background is mostly in construction, and also worked with Ebuku too. 

Constructions: panels, made of the waste, core is made of the composite - ash, etc, and inside volcanic rock. 
Combining sustainable materials + technology.

Surabaya mud, fly ash, and 5% concrete.
Sustainable, waste product and reusable. No fossil fuel is burned versus when using concrete. 

Panel production is in China - 3 weeks to import. 

Plastic panels example: Nev Hyman - the new house (https://www.forbes.com/sites/kittyknowles/2018/01/19/nev-house-prefab-housing-architecture-surfing-green-business-pitch-at-palace/?sh=6caf403b6391)

Colun is interested in tokenized housing - micro investments too.

His chemical engineer for the project - Markus. 

⅔ of products that are ready, we can use for the project. 
Unit village can showcase a case study of social housing in Indonesia, which is not developed yet.

Next Steps:

Colun will talk to his designer, and will share solar panels contacts. 
We will be sending exact dimensions to create a prototype.
